 Project STELLAR: The Comprehensive Blueprint
Our Vision: To build the foundational trust layer for the future of agricultural finance, creating a world where every farmer's hard work is a bankable asset, starting in Punjab and scaling to the globe.

Project Name: STELLAR
Stands For: Satellite Trusted Evaluation & Lending Ledger Architecture Record.

1. The Problem: The Farmer's Debt Cycle (The "Why")
In the fertile lands of Punjab, a farmer's reality is a paradox of wealth and debt. While their land is productive, their access to timely, fair capital is virtually non-existent. A farmer needing ₹50,000 for seeds before the sowing season faces a broken system:

Banks are Slow & Demanding: They require extensive land records (patwari documents), a formal credit history (which the farmer lacks), and a multi-week approval process that doesn't match the urgent timelines of agriculture.

The Moneylender (Arhtiya) Trap: The only alternative is the local moneylender, who provides instant cash but at crippling interest rates (often 3-5% per month). One bad harvest or medical emergency can spiral into a debt cycle that lasts for generations.

The core issue is a lack of trustworthy, real-time data. The farmer's greatest asset—their productive land and future harvest—is invisible and illiquid to the formal financial world. STELLAR is built to solve this data and trust gap.

2. The Solution: A Multi-Layered Oracle for Bulletproof Trust (The "How")
STELLAR creates a verifiable, data-rich profile for a farm, making it a safe, attractive asset for any lender. This is achieved through three layers of analysis.

Layer 1: The Core Engine (Automated Data Analysis)

Historical Analysis: We pull 5+ years of public satellite imagery (from Sentinel-2 and Landsat missions) for the farm's exact GPS coordinates. Our AI model analyzes the historical Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to establish a baseline of the farm's consistency, seasonality, and historical productivity.

Real-Time Analysis: We cross-reference current satellite images with live data from weather oracles (for drought/flood warnings in the specific district) and price oracles (for current crop prices at the local Mandi). This creates a live "health and value" snapshot.

Layer 2: The Trust Layer (The Human Verification DePIN)

The Verifier Network: We create a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) of local, on-the-ground "Verifiers." These could be agricultural students, retired farmers, or trusted members of local co-ops.

The Trust Circle Mechanism: To prevent fraud, a Verifier cannot act alone. They must join or form a "Trust Circle" of 3-5 members. To activate the circle, each member must stake a meaningful amount of CTC. If any member of the circle is proven to have submitted a fraudulent report, the entire circle's stake is slashed. This creates powerful social and economic pressure for honesty.

Layer 3: The Security Stamp (The Unforgeable Proof)

CTC-0 Integration: For the highest level of trust, every final report submitted by a Verifier is sent to the Creditcoin CTC-0 satellite's oracle.

The oracle returns a cryptographic signature that provides an immutable, on-chain timestamp and geolocation proof. This proves the verification happened at a specific place and time, making the report data unforgeable and solving the problem of "old data" fraud.

3. User Journeys
The Farmer (Baljeet):

Onboarding: Baljeet registers on the STELLAR app with his phone number and marks the boundaries of his 5-acre farm on a map.

Credit Profile Built: STELLAR's engine automatically performs the Layer 1 analysis, creating his initial farm profile. A local Verifier is dispatched for the Layer 2/3 check.

Loan Access: Once verified, his dashboard shows he has a credit line of ₹75,000. He draws ₹50,000 for seeds, which is instantly disbursed to his connected bank account/wallet.

Repayment: After a successful harvest and sale, he repays the loan directly through the app.

Building History: This entire successful loan cycle is recorded on the Creditcoin ledger via the Credal API, increasing his credit score and unlocking better terms for his next loan.

The Verifier (Priya):

Staking: Priya, an agriculture student, forms a Trust Circle with four classmates. They each stake 100 CTC into the circle's smart contract to become active Verifiers.

Receiving a Job: She receives a notification for a verification job 5km away.

Verification: She visits Baljeet's farm, uses the app to take geotagged photos, and confirms the automated data from Layer 1 is correct.

Confirmation: Her report is timestamped by the CTC-0 oracle. Upon successful submission, she and her circle members receive a fee paid in CTC.

4. Technical Architecture & Tech Stack
Smart Contracts (Solidity, OpenZeppelin on Creditcoin Testnet):

StellarFarmNFT.sol: An ERC-721 contract where each NFT represents a verified farm, holding its metadata and historical data hashes.

StellarVerifierRegistry.sol: Manages the Trust Circles, CTC staking, and reputation scores for Verifiers.

StellarLendingPool.sol: Handles the DeFi logic for loan deposits (USDC), disbursements, and interest calculations.

Backend (Node.js, Python):

Data Processor: Connects to Sentinel Hub APIs to fetch and process satellite imagery. Runs the AI/NDVI analysis model.

Oracle Integrator: Connects to weather/price oracles and the CTC-0 satellite oracle.

Credal API Service: Manages all communication with the Creditcoin ledger for recording credit history.

Frontend (React, Next.js, Ethers.js, Tailwind CSS):

A mobile-first web application with distinct dashboards for Farmers, Verifiers, and Lenders.

5. Tokenomics: The CTC Flywheel
The entire STELLAR economy is designed to create a sustainable "flywheel" that drives utility and demand for the native CTC token.

Value Inflow (Demand for CTC):

Staking for Verifiers: The primary demand driver. To participate as a Verifier and earn fees, users must acquire and stake CTC. As the platform grows, more CTC is locked, reducing circulating supply.

Gas Fees: Every on-chain action (minting an NFT, staking, taking a loan) requires CTC for gas, creating constant baseline demand.

Value Outflow (Rewards in CTC):

Verifier Fees: Verifiers are paid for their successful, honest work in CTC, rewarding them with the network's native asset.

Lender Interest (Optional): Lenders who provide USDC to the loan pool can receive their interest payments in CTC, giving them a stake in the ecosystem's success.

The Flywheel Effect:

More farmers join STELLAR, creating more demand for verification jobs.

More verifiers are needed, so they must buy and stake more CTC.

This increases the security of the network and locks up CTC.

Higher security attracts more lenders, leading to better loan terms for farmers.

Better terms attract more farmers, restarting the cycle.

6. Risks & Mitigations
Technical Risk: CTC-0 Oracle API is not publicly available during the hackathon.

Mitigation: The project is designed to work without it. The CTC-0 integration is a "bonus" feature for Phase 3. The core value is in Layers 1 and 2. We will simulate the oracle response for the demo if needed.

Market Risk: Difficulty in recruiting the initial set of Verifiers.

Mitigation: Partner with local agricultural universities (like Punjab Agricultural University) to recruit students. The "Trust Circle" mechanism also allows them to onboard trusted peers easily.

Execution Risk: The project scope is too ambitious for the 5-week timeline.

Mitigation: The "Hybrid Strategy" build plan is designed specifically to manage this. We will secure a working, prize-winning demo in the first two weeks before moving to more advanced features.

7. Our "Moonshot" Edge (Why We Win)
Bulletproof Trust. While other projects might propose using satellite data, our multi-layered approach is our killer feature. The combination of AI Analysis + a Human Trust Layer with Skin-in-the-Game + a Cryptographic Stamp from Space creates a level of data integrity that is unmatched. We are not just building another lending app; we are building a foundational trust protocol for real-world assets that can make Creditcoin the global leader in agricultural finance.

8. The 5-Week Build Plan (The Hybrid Strategy)
Weeks 1-2 (The Foundation):

Contracts: Deploy basic StellarFarmNFT and LendingPool contracts.

Backend: Set up the satellite data pipeline for a single, hard-coded farm location.

Frontend: Build the core Farmer workflow: onboard a farm, see a (mock) score, and request a loan.

Goal: A guaranteed working demo.

Week 3 (The Trust Layer):

Contracts: Build and deploy the StellarVerifierRegistry with the CTC staking and Trust Circle logic.

Backend: Create the endpoints for Verifiers to submit reports.

Frontend: Build the Verifier dashboard and workflow.

Goal: Add our key differentiator.

Week 4 (The Moonshot Layer):

Backend: If the CTC-0 oracle API is accessible, integrate the timestamping feature into the Verifier report submission process.

Frontend: Display the "Verified by CTC-0" badge on successful reports.

Goal: Secure the 1st place prize.

Week 5 (Polish & Pitch):

Finalize UI/UX, deploy all services to a stable test environment, record the demo video, and perfect the final presentation.

9. The 3-Minute Winning Pitch (Demo Script)
(Scene: Pitch stage, slide showing a photo of a farmer in a field)

Presenter: "This is Baljeet, a farmer in Punjab. He's one of 500 million smallholder farmers who feed the world, yet he can't get a fair loan. His bank says he has no credit history. We say his credit history is written in the Earth itself. We built STELLAR to read it."

(Action: Switch to the live app demo - Farmer's View)

Presenter: "With STELLAR, Baljeet simply outlines his farm on a map. Our engine instantly analyzes years of satellite data to see his farm's real productivity. But a picture isn't enough. To get a loan, data needs to be trusted. That's where our Verifier Network comes in."

(Action: Switch to Verifier's View)

Presenter: "Priya, a local student, gets a verification job. She's part of a 'Trust Circle,' so she and her friends have staked their own CTC as a guarantee of honesty. She visits the farm, confirms the data, and submits her report."

(Action: Show the report with a "Verified" badge)

Presenter: "But we go one step further. For unforgeable proof, that report is timestamped by Creditcoin's brand new CTC-0 satellite. This data is now bulletproof."

(Action: Switch back to Farmer's View, showing an approved credit line)

Presenter: "With his farm now a trusted, bankable asset, Baljeet has an instant credit line. He can get the capital he needs with a single click. This successful loan is now the first entry in his permanent, global credit history, recorded on Creditcoin via the Credal API."

(Final Slide: STELLAR Logo with Creditcoin Logo)

Presenter: "STELLAR isn't just a lending app; it's a foundational trust protocol for real-world assets. We are building the future of agricultural finance, and we're building it on Creditcoin. Thank you."
